BUGS:
; Slugs aren't unicode safe. See [reddit discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/lisp/comments/yvh6g/coleslaw_jekylllike_static_blogware_in_500_lines/) and [mozilla code](https://github.com/mozilla/unicode-slugify/blob/master/slugify/__init__.py).

TODO:

; Add SHOUT content type.
;; needs: shout template/render function. Twitter\Disqus integration with shouts?
;; Indices fundamentally don't know about content-types. Is that a problem?
;; Rename index.posts to something else?
