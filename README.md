* Example sites: [redlinernotes](http://redlinernotes.com/blog/) and [(lisp :is 'fun)](http://blub.co.za/).

## Installation
This software should be portable to any conforming Common Lisp implementation but this guide will assume SBCL is installed. Testing has also been done on CCL.
Server side setup:

1. Setup git and create a bare repo as shown [here](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-on-the-Server-Setting-Up-the-Server).
2. Install Lisp and [Quicklisp](http://quicklisp.org/).
3. ```wget -c https://raw.github.com/redline6561/coleslaw/master/examples/single-site.coleslawrc -O ~/.coleslawrc``` # and edit as necessary
4. ```wget -c https://raw.github.com/redline6561/coleslaw/master/examples/example.post-receive -O your-blog.git/hooks/post-receive``` # and edit as necessary
5. ```chmod +x your-blog/.git/hooks/post-receive```
6. Create or clone your blog repo locally. Add your server as a remote with ```git remote add prod git@my-host.com:path/to/repo.git```
7. Point the web server of your choice at the symlink /path/to/deploy-dir/.curr/

Now whenever you push a new commit to the server, coleslaw will update your blog automatically! You may need to git push -u prod master the first time.

## The Post Format
Coleslaw expects post files to be formatted as follows:
```
;;;;;
title: foo
tags: bar, baz
date: yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss
format: html (for raw html) or md (for markdown)
;;;;;
your post
```

## Importing from Wordpress
There is a "plugin" to import from wordpress. At some point, it should be turned into a standalone script. Until then...

1. Export your posts from wordpress.
2. In your lisp of choice, do the following:
   1. ```(ql:quickload 'coleslaw)```
   2. ```(in-package :coleslaw)```
   3. ```(load-plugins '(import))```
   4. ```(coleslaw-import::import-posts "/path/to/export.xml")```

The XML will be read and placed into .post files in the :repo location specified in your [.coleslawrc](http://github.com/redline6561/coleslaw/blob/master/examples/single-site.coleslawrc).

## Writing your own plugins
For now, see the [API](http://redlinernotes.com/docs/coleslaw.html) and the [mathjax plugin](https://github.com/redline6561/coleslaw/blob/master/plugins/mathjax.lisp) for an example.
A proper guide about this will be written later.

## Theming
A default theme, hyde, is provided. Themes are made using Google's closure-template and the source for [hyde](https://github.com/redline6561/coleslaw/tree/master/themes/hyde) should be simple and instructive until I can provide better docs.
